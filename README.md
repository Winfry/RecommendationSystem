# RecommendationSystem
A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users.The goal of a recommender system is to generate meaningful recommendations to a collection of users for items or products that might interest them.In this caswe project, it has to do with Agricultural crops.

# INTRODUCTION
This paper aims to recommend the most suitable crop based on input parameters like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), PH value of soil, Humidity, Temperature, and Rainfall. This paper predicts the accuracy of the future production of eleven different crops. This proposed
system applied different kinds of Machine Learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes (NB),Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost(XGB)

# The five phases are as per the following:
1) Collection of Datasets
2) Pre-processing (Noise Removal)
3) Feature Extraction
4) Applied Various Machine Learning Algorithm
5) Recommendation System
6) Recommended Crop
